	"title": "Wattlab and HGK Shipping team up for world's first solar-powered inland shipping vessel",
	"intro": "Dutch maritime solar innovator Wattlab has delivered a solar energy system for HGK Shipping’s inland shipping cargo vessel Blue Marlin. Representing a major technical milestone and step forward for sustainable inland shipping, the vessel’s 200 solar panels will provide power to both the onboard and propulsion systems, making the Blue Marlin the first inland shipping vessel in the world capable of sailing with solar power. Wattlab, which is also active in the seagoing shipping industry, brings broad maritime experience to this pioneering project.",
	"body": ["HGK Shipping is a European inland waterway shipping company operating a fleet of 350 vessels. With annual freight figures in the region of 43 million tonnes, HGK Shipping is considered to be a leading player in European dry bulk, gas and chemical transport.",
	"Wattlab has worked previously with HGK Shipping. In Q2 2024, HGK’s 135-metre long dry cargo vessel MS Helios made headlines – and entered The Guinness Book of Records – for having the world’s largest solar panel installation on an inland shipping vessel. The MS Helios is equipped with 312 solar panels.",
	"The solar energy systems of the Helios and the Blue Marlin differ in one critical aspect. Unlike the Helios, where solar energy was used exclusively for low-voltage onboard (hotel) systems, the Blue Marlin features a more advanced, fully integrated system capable of contributing power directly to the ship’s high voltage electric propulsion. This, says Wattlab co-founder and COO David Kester, is a technical milestone. “The Blue Marlin’s 200 solar panels are not only connected to the low-voltage onboard systems but also to the high-voltage propulsion network. This means that HGK Shipping can proudly state that they are the first inland shipping company to operate a vessel that uses solar power directly for propulsion.”",
	"Delivering up to 35 kilowatts under optimal conditions, the Blue Marlin’s solar power system will operate in conjunction with four diesel generators powering the electric propulsion system. This fully integrated setup enables ‘peak shaving’, where the combination of solar energy and batteries will prevent the need for activating an additional generator during high-demand periods. The system’s automated energy management will distribute electrical energy where and when it is required, increasing efficiency and reducing fuel consumption.",
	"“Furthermore, in situations where the ship is lightly loaded and travelling downstream, we anticipate that it may even sail using only solar power for limited periods—an unprecedented achievement in the inland shipping sector,” continues Kester.",
	"The Helios and Blue Marlin also differ in their operating profile; a fact that could provide HGK Shipping with further efficiency gains. “We are very much looking forward to seeing the real-world operational yields of this new solar array. Unlike the Helios, which makes shorter trips and often opens its hatches for loading and unloading, the Blue Marlin will be deployed for longer voyages, keeping the hatches closed for extended periods – perfect for continuous solar energy generation,” says INSERT NAME from HGK Shipping. “We are proud to pioneer the use of solar propulsion in inland shipping. The Blue Marlin demonstrates what’s possible when innovation meets engineering expertise.”",
	"Installation of the Blue Marlin’s solar panels took place at the De Gerlien van Tiem shipyard with Wattlab cooperating closely with Blommaert Aluminium and Van Tiem Electro. “We have been working with these partners for some time now – on multiple vessels – so have managed to really optimise the processes. The Blue Marlin is a new-build vessel; it took about one week for installation followed by a few days for commissioning,” adds Kester. “Considering a similar-sized retrofit project, we estimate that a shipowner would be looking at a downtime of no more than one week.”",
	"This project also marks a broader evolution in maritime decarbonization strategies. As regulatory pressure increases and fuel prices fluctuate, shipowners and operators are looking to diversify their energy mix. Wattlab’s scalable solar solutions are proving their viability not only on inland waterways but also on coastal and seagoing vessels, where hybrid propulsion systems are gaining traction."

	"title": "Wattlab launches SolarDeck: plug-and-play solar power for seagoing shipping",
	"intro": "Wattlab, the Netherlands-based maritime solar specialist, is proud to introduce its SolarDeck to the seagoing shipping industry. SolarDeck is a modular and scalable system of deck-mounted solar panels that yield significant reductions in fuel consumption and CO2 emissions. Moreover, based on installation on a seagoing general cargo vessel, SolarDeck combines substantial savings via Fuel EU Maritime and EU ETS regulations and an expected return on investment of 3-5 years.",
	"body": ["Established in 2017, Wattlab has spent its first years of operations focusing on the inland shipping sector with its Solar Flatrack. This is a modular solar energy system consisting of movable and stackable integrated solar panels and inverters. To date, Wattlab’s SolarHatches have been installed on more than 25 inland shipping vessels.",
	"With the aim to reduce fuel costs for seagoing shipowners and facilitate the continued decarbonisation of the maritime sector, Wattlab is now expanding into the seagoing shipping industry with SolarDeck.",
	"“At all times during the design of SolarDeck, we prioritised the shipowner’s requirements. We know that ‘time is money’. That’s why the SolarDeck can be installed in a minimum amount of time using container twist lock fittings. It also does not impact normal loading and unloading procedures,” says Wattlab’s CEO Bo Salet. “However, we also know – for cargo shipowners especially – that ‘space is money’. In the event of a deck load such as offshore wind blades, the ship’s crew can store the SolarDeck inside the volume of a 20-foot container, thus freeing up the deck for cargo.”",
	"Developing SolarDeck with Vertom and TNO. SolarDeck has proven credentials: in collaboration with the Dutch Organisation for Applied Scientific Research TNO and international shipping company Vertom, Wattlab has spent the previous 18 months developing and testing the new system on board Vertom’s 7,280dwt general purpose dry cargo vessel Anette, in a project co-financed by the European Union’s Just Transition Fund. The results from the testing phase are positive.",
	"“The test results show that SolarDeck performs well in the tougher environment – in terms of salinity and rougher sea states – of coastal shipping. Because salt water can drain freely from the solar panels, there’s no chance of a salt crust forming. As such, SolarDeck generates the expected power output levels,” Salet explains. “Furthermore, the system is robust enough to withstand storms as well as the usual day-to-day activities on board a seagoing cargo ship – while staying safe at all times.”",
	"Fuel and emission reductions. Based on the test results (Vertom’s Anette is 119 metres long and 14 metres wide), Wattlab predicts reductions of 20 MT fuel and 68 MT CO₂ emissions per year for this coaster-type. Such numbers are substantial enough to have a significant impact on a shipowner’s EEXI and CII scores in addition to potential savings via Fuel EU Maritime and EU ETS regulations. Note that for larger vessels, the efficiency gains are also (much) larger.",
	"“We are excited to introduce SolarDeck to the seagoing shipping industry – to show shipowners what this system can mean to their operations,” Salet concludes. “SolarDeck isn’t just a green upgrade. With a return on investment of 3 to 5 years, it’s a smart investment.”",
	"JTF Fund. Wattlab’s SolarDeck pilot project has been co-financed by the European Union’s Just Transition Fund (JTF). The JTF is a new instrument of the Cohesion Policy 2021-2027, as the first pillar of the Just Transition Mechanism in the context of the European Green Deal aiming at achieving EU climate-neutrality by 2050."

	"intro": "Wattlab, the Dutch ‘solar power for shipping’ start-up, is not a company that rests on its laurels. After demonstrating impressive growth in panel-project that has made its way into the Guinness Book of World Records), Wattlab is currently taking its first steps in the seagoing shipping sector. With the first pilot project now complete, it’s time for us to catch up with the company’s founder and CEO Bo Salet to find out more about the results from the pilot project. And to learn more about Wattlab’s ambitions to bring solar power to seagoing shipping with a product called SolarDeck.",
	"body": [
		"Established in 2017, Wattlab has spent its first years of operations focusing on the inland shipping sector with its Solar Flatrack. This is a modular solar energy system consisting of movable and stackable integrated solar panels and inverters. To date, Wattlab’s SolarHatches have been installed on more than 25 inland shipping vessels.",
		"Starting in May 2024, Wattlab’s SolarDeck pilot project had two main partners: the Dutch Organisation for Applied Scientific Research TNO and international shipping company Vertom. Furthermore, the pilot has been co-financed by the European Union, or to be precise: by the EU’s Just Transition Fund which is part of the EU’s aims to achieve climate-neutrality by 2050.",
		"“We brought in TNO to focus on the solar power generation of our new product; their aim was to validate whether the power output – and therefore subsequent fuel reduction – was in line with expectations,” begins Bo. “But we also had to validate many other aspects of the SolarDeck. For example, the construction characteristics: taking the salt water and rougher sea states into account, it’s obvious that seagoing ships operate in a tougher environment than inland shipping vessels. For this second validation aspect, we were able to use Vertom’s 7,280dwt general purpose dry cargo vessel Anette, on which we installed one SolarDeck module.”",
		"Let’s not wait any longer… what are the results of Wattlab’s SolarDeck pilot project? “We recently heard back from TNO that the SolarDeck’s power output is in line with expectations. This positive evaluation is very good. This is partially due to the design; salt water can drain freely from the solar panels; this means that there is no salt crust build-up from evaporated salt water that lowers the power output. And, in terms of the structural integrity of the system, we are happy to report a success. There are some parts of the design that need fine-tuning but there are absolutely no red flags whatsoever. The Anette saw some tough storms during the pilot project, which the SolarDeck dealt with without any damage. What’s more – from a durability viewpoint – we designed this system in such a way that, if there are damages or breakages, then these can be easily repaired by the ship’s crew at minimal cost,” Bo answers. “In addition, we are happy to be able to report many other positive results from this pilot project.”",
		"Safety first. From a safety perspective, SolarDeck performed well. “This system is a stand-alone solar power generator that uses a similar power conversion configuration to our inland shipping product. It is, therefore, inherently safe to use. For example, in the event of cable damage or breakage, the system shuts down automatically; there will never be a current on a broken cable.”",
		"Solar panels are not renowned for their strength. As such, looking at the photos of the SolarDeck installed on Vertom’s Anette, you would be forgiven for wondering if the presence of a wafer-thin solar panel would impact the day-to-day operations of a typical ship’s crew. “We specifically asked the Anette’s crew to carry on their usual deck cleaning activities,” he notes. “This involved rinsing with fresh water, cleaning with normal soap, and also with their toughest cleaning material: heavy duty acidic descaling liquid. The SolarDeck continued working at all times.”",
		"What’s next for SolarDeck? Now that the SolarDeck pilot project has been completed with undoubtedly successful results, Wattlab has its sights set on bigger targets (or rather, larger surface areas). “We are moving towards full scale; this will be a vessel with the entire deck covered with SolarDeck panels. We will be delivering this before the summer, also in collaboration with Vertom Shipping: a partnership that we are very pleased with,” Bo says.",
		"The deck of a seagoing cargo ship covered with solar panels will definitely be a sight worth seeing. But what about the ship’s loading and unloading operations? Won’t the SolarDeck get in the way? And what about monitoring and managing (surplus) power supply? Won’t that demand a time investment from the crew? “During normal loading and unloading, the SolarDeck can stay in place because it’s thin enough that it fits between two stacked hatches. The only action needed is to disconnect the cables, which needs a minimal amount of time: two minutes of work per edge,” he answers. “And let’s say that the shipowner has a job that involves a deck load: offshore wind blades, for instance. We designed the SolarDeck based on standard 20-foot container twist lock fittings. They are light enough to be carried and the crew can stack all of them within the volume of one 20-foot container.”",
		"“And to answer the question of power output management, the crew doesn’t have to actively think about this; it will be automatic. The generators will turn off when they're not needed. And in the event of a surplus of solar power, the panels will automatically shut down so the they will never overload the system.”",
		"Let’s talk business. Bo wraps up our conversation with a look at probably the most important aspects of owning a seagoing cargo vessel: the regulations and the return on investment. “Based on the results of the pilot project, we predict a fuel reduction of 30 MT with a corresponding 96 MT drop in CO2 emissions. Looking at a shipowner’s EXI and CII scores, this is significant. Moreover, the lower fuel consumption will save shipowners money via the Fuel EU Maritime and EU ETS regulations. And regarding the business case we predict an ROI of around four to five years, not taking any possible subsidies into account. And there is another thing to consider: in general, the older the vessel is, the more inefficient its generators are. Therefore, the business case for installing deck-mounted solar panels is even better with older vessels. And because they are ‘plug-and-play’, they are not a permanent installation: you can simply lift them off the older vessel and put them on the next one,” Bo concludes.",
		"Stay tuned for to find out more about Wattlab’s work on  bringing solar power to the shipping industry."

	"intro": "Het Nederlandse clean-tech bedrijf Wattlab, specialist in maritieme zonne-energie, introduceert met trots zijn nieuwe oplossing voor de zeevaart: SolarDeck. SolarDeck is een modulair en schaalbaar systeem van dek-gemonteerde zonnepanelen dat aanzienlijke besparingen oplevert op brandstofverbruik en CO₂-uitstoot. Op basis van een installatie op een zeegaand general cargo-schip combineert SolarDeck substantiële voordelen via FuelEU Maritime en EU ETS-regelgeving met een verwachte terugverdientijd van 3 tot 5 jaar.",
	"body": ["Wattlab, opgericht in 2017, richtte zich de eerste jaren op de binnenvaart met het Solar Flatrack-systeem – een modulair energiesysteem met verplaatsbare en stapelbare zonnepanelen en geïntegreerde omvormers. Inmiddels zijn Wattlab’s SolarHatches geïnstalleerd op meer dan 25 binnenvaartschepen.",
		"Met de ambitie om brandstofkosten voor zeevarende reders te verlagen en de verduurzaming van de sector te versnellen, breidt Wattlab nu uit naar de zeevaart met SolarDeck. “Bij het ontwerpen van SolarDeck hebben we steeds de eisen van reders centraal gesteld. We weten: tijd is geld. Daarom is SolarDeck binnen minimale tijd te installeren dankzij twistlock-containeraansluitingen,” zegt Bo Salet, CEO van Wattlab.",
		"“We weten ook: ruimte is geld. Als het dek wordt gebruikt voor bijvoorbeeld offshore windturbinebladen, kan de bemanning het SolarDeck systeem opslaan in een 20-voets container, waardoor het dek weer beschikbaar is voor vracht.”",
		"Ontwikkeld met Vertom en TNO. SolarDeck is uitvoerig getest: in samenwerking met TNO en rederij Vertom werkte Wattlab de afgelopen 18 maanden aan de ontwikkeling en praktijkproeven aan boord van Vertom’s 7.280 dwt general cargo-schip Anette. Het project werd mede gefinancierd door het Just Transition Fund (JTF) van de Europese Unie. De testresultaten zijn positief.",
		"“SolarDeck presteert goed in de zwaardere omstandigheden van de kustvaart, zoals zout, wind en golfslag,” legt Salet uit. “Zout water stroomt gemakkelijk weg van de panelen, waardoor er geen zoutkorst kan ontstaan. De opgewekte energie ligt op het verwachte niveau. Bovendien is het systeem robuust genoeg om stormen en dagelijks gebruik op een zeeschip aan te kunnen – met behoud van veiligheid.”",
		"Brandstof- en emissiereductie. Op basis van de testresultaten met de Annette (119 m x 14 m), voorspelt Wattlab een jaarlijkse besparing van 20 ton brandstof en 68 ton CO₂ voor dit type coaster. Deze cijfers hebben een duidelijke invloed op EEXI- en CII-scores, en leveren directe voordelen op binnen de FuelEU Maritime en EU ETS-kaders. Voor grotere schepen zijn de potentiële besparingen nog aanzienlijk groter.",
		"“We zijn erg blij met de testresultaten en zijn enthousiast om SolarDeck nu te kunnen introduceren in de zeevaart – en om reders te laten zien wat dit systeem voor hun operatie kan betekenen,” zegt Salet. “SolarDeck is niet alleen een groene upgrade. Met een terugverdientijd van 3 tot 5 jaar is het ook gewoon een slimme investering.”",
